# Insane-Auto-Clicker
InsaneAutoClicker is a high-performance, multithreaded auto-clicker written in C#. This program simulates rapid mouse clicks with 10 parallel threads, achieving extremely high click rates. The auto-clicker runs until the F9 key is pressed, at which point it stops all click threads and terminates cleanly.
